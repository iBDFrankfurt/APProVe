APProVe is a software developed by the Interdisciplinary Biomaterials and Database Frankfurt (iBDF) for easy application of biosamples and clinical data for research projects. It enables researchers and employees of the iBDF to clearly manage and track project requests to the biobank and maps the complete process from application submission to sample distribution and project completion.
